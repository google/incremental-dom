# Common Bazel settings for JavaScript/NodeJS workspaces
# This rc file is automatically discovered when Bazel is run in this workspace,
# see https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/guide.html#bazelrc
#
# The full list of Bazel options: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html

# Bazel will create symlinks from the workspace directory to output artifacts.
# Build results will be placed in a directory called "dist/bin"
# Other directories will be created like "dist/testlogs"
# Be aware that this will still create a bazel-out symlink in
# your project directory, which you must exclude from version control and your
# editor's search path.
build --symlink_prefix=dist/
# To disable the symlinks altogether (including bazel-out) you can use
# build --symlink_prefix=/
# however this makes it harder to find outputs.

# Specifies desired output mode for running tests.
# Valid values are
#   'summary' to output only test status summary
#   'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests
#   'all' to print logs for all tests
#   'streamed' to output logs for all tests in real time
#     (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless of --test_strategy value).
test --test_output=errors

# Support for debugging NodeJS tests
# Add the Bazel option `--config=debug` to enable this
test:debug --test_arg=--node_options=--inspect-brk --test_output=streamed --test_strategy=exclusive --test_timeout=9999 --nocache_test_results

# Turn off legacy external runfiles
# This prevents accidentally depending on this feature, which Bazel will remove.
run --nolegacy_external_runfiles
test --nolegacy_external_runfiles

# Prevent TypeScript worker seeing files not declared as inputs
build --worker_sandboxing

# Turn on the "Managed Directories" feature.
# This allows Bazel to share the same node_modules directory with other tools
# NB: this option was introduced in Bazel 0.26
# See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--experimental_allow_incremental_repository_updates
common --experimental_allow_incremental_repository_updates

# Turn on --incompatible_strict_action_env which was on by default
# in Bazel 0.21.0 but turned off again in 0.22.0. Follow
# https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7026 for more details.
# This flag is needed to so that the bazel cache is not invalidated
# when running bazel via `yarn bazel`.
# See https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27514.

# Load any settings specific to the current user.
# .bazelrc.user should appear in .gitignore so that settings are not shared with team members
# This needs to be last statement in this
# config, as the user configuration should be able to overwrite flags from this file.
# See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/best-practices.html#bazelrc
# (Note that we use .bazelrc.user so the file appears next to .bazelrc in directory listing,
# rather than user.bazelrc as suggested in the Bazel docs)

# Turn on managed directories feature in Bazel
# This allows us to avoid installing a second copy of node_modules
common --experimental_allow_incremental_repository_updates

# Prevent TS worker from trying to expand the `includes` section in tsconfig.json.
# It would find the "test/*.ts" reference when compiling //src:src, and the FileCache will then error
# when TS attempts to read one of these files that doesn't belong in the compilation.
