# Change Log

## 0.7.0

- Added an option to specify which attribute to use for a key when importing
  DOM nodes
- Improve handling of cached value for `Text` nodes when using formatting
  functions
- Added an option to specify a custom matching function via `createPatchInner`
  and `createPatchOuter`
- Added a call flow to open an element, then apply attributes using the new
  `applyStatics` and `applyAttrs` functions along with the existing `open` and
  `close` calls, allowing you to use information from the element in when
  specifying the attributes
